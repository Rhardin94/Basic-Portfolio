      <!--Bio-->  
      <p>I am currently a student of Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp and I am fascinated by all things technology! 
        <br>
         While earning my Bachelor's degree from Illinois State Universiy I planned to study both Acting and Computer Science/Information technology.
        <br><br>
         As most people are interested in multiple subjects, I split my focus to my two passions: Acting and Technology; however, as the semesters progressed I had to chose between my passions due to time constraints.
         <br>
         I do not regret my decision to chose Acting first, as I always planned to continue my studies of all things techology at a later date.
         <br><br>
         Thanks to Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp, I now have the chance to not only study in a technologically oriented field but to combine my creativity centered experiece studying acting as well!
